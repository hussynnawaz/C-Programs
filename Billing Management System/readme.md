Import the Necessary Libraries
Identifying the C++ libraries that our software will require as a first step. At the commencement of the presentation, these will be given. The header files are imported using #include from a library, iostream is the first library that our app needs. We'll use this library to manage our Supermarket Billing Project using C++ basic input and output.
