Algorithm of Adding two Numbers
1 Step: START.

2 Step: Initialize integers A, B and C.

3 Step: Accept two integers A and B from User.

3 Step: Now do the operation using formula C=A+B.

4 Step: Now the addition is stored in C Variable.

5 Step: Print C.

6 Step: STOP.

Now we will do this arithmetic operation in C++. There are different methods to make an Addition in C++ we will see it one by one.
