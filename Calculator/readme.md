A calculator is a portable device that helps to perform simple mathematical calculations in our daily lives such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc. Some of the scientific calculators are used to perform complex calculation more easily like square root, function, exponential operations, logarithm, trigonometric function and hyperbolic function, etc. In this section, we will create calculator program in C++ using function and do-while loop.
